FIVE-YEAR SUMMARY AND TRENDS
================================================================================

YIELD PROGRESSION:
2019: 2.1 t/ha (baseline)
2020: 2.4 t/ha (+14%)
2021: 2.6 t/ha (+8%)
2022: 2.7 t/ha (+4%)
2023: 2.8 t/ha (+4%)
Total improvement: +33% over 5 years

WATER USE EFFICIENCY:
- Most efficient: 2021 (480mm for 2.6 t/ha = 5.4 kg/mm)
- Least efficient: 2020 (520mm for 2.4 t/ha = 4.6 kg/mm)
- Optimal range appears to be 480-510mm total water

FERTILIZATION INSIGHTS:
- NPK application optimal at 150-155 kg/ha
- Potassium sulfate at 70-75 kg/ha during flowering critical
- Rhizobium inoculation essential (adds ~0.3 t/ha)
- Micronutrients provide 5-8% yield boost

NDVI AS PREDICTOR:
- Peak NDVI correlates strongly with final yield
- NDVI > 0.80 at week 8-9 indicates excellent crop health
- Sustained high NDVI during weeks 8-12 predicts yields > 2.5 t/ha

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YEAR 2024-2025:
Based on 5-year analysis, optimal protocol should include:
1. Gazelle variety (proven performance)
2. Planting mid-November (avoid early season stress)
3. Water: 490-510mm total, with peak application weeks 8-12
4. NPK 10-20-10: 155 kg/ha at planting
5. Potassium sulfate: 75 kg/ha at early flowering (week 8)
6. Rhizobium inoculation mandatory
7. Foliar micronutrients: weeks 4 and 11
8. Target NDVI > 0.82 during peak period

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
- Yield target: 2.9-3.1 tons/hectare
- Peak NDVI: 0.85-0.88
- Protein content: 40-42%
- Water use efficiency: > 5.5 kg/mm
